# PHP playground
Test and ideas

---

Run the app with ```docker-compose up```.  
Requires docker and docker compose.   
Edit the ```docker-compose.yml``` for control over which port to expose etc.

---

Compile the scss by running ```compass watch``` in the root.   
Requires ruby-compass ```sudo apt install ruby-compass```.

The file based CMS included is called Triangle and lives in this name space.   
The Triangle arguably is the simplest instrument in the classical orchestra. So while other great PHP projects in the musical genre (e.g. Symphony, Composer and others) are big and complicated, Triangle fills the role of simplicity.
